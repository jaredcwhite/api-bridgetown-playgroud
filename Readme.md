#  Bridgetown / Roda API Playground

A little test to see if i can get bridgetown to serve as an API playground for a simple API
- put the gemfile at the top and remove the one from the bridgetown site
- created a small api that gets mounted as a routing tree
- created a top level Roda app that requires all deps and boots ok
- bridgetown routes not quite working

There is a test.http file that can be used to make requests to the API. Assume [this utility](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
